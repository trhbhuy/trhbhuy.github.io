  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of [Future Convergence Technology](https://sites.google.com/view/iot-network-lab-sch/home?authuser=0) at [Soonchunhyang University](https://sgee.sch.ac.kr/). My research focuses on addressing challenges in modern power and energy systems, particularly in energy-related modeling, forecasting, and optimization. I have a strong emphasis on integrating renewable energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, and hydrogen) and flexible resources (e.g., energy storage systems and electric vehicles) to reduce operating costs and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon future.
