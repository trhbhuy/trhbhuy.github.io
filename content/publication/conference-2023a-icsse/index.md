abstract: |
  The widespread implementation of renewable energy sources is posing new and distinct challenges for power systems. Consequently, power system state estimation has become increasingly essential for monitoring, operating, and safeguarding modern power systems. Traditionally, physics-based models such as weighted least square or weighted least absolute value were utilized, which classically analyze a single snapshot of the systems and fail to capture the temporal connections of system states. This study exploits the potential of machine learning approaches to forecast the state values of power systems. The performance and stability of innovative machine learning methodologies are validated using the IEEE systems. The results of the simulations are encouraging, showing the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed machine learning methods for power system state estimation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study applies machine learning algorithms, including ANN, Random Forest, and XGBoost, for enhanced power system state estimation, demonstrating their effectiveness on IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems.
