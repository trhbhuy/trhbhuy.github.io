abstract: |
  A new chaotic search group algorithm (CSGA) is proposed in this study for simultaneous network reconfiguration and allocation of distributed generation (SNR-DG) in a radial distribution network (RDN) with the objective of minimizing real power loss. The CSGA, an improved metaheuristic algorithm, integrates a chaotic local search strategy with the original SGA to enhance search performance. Tested on 33-, 69-, 84-, and 118-bus RDNs, the proposed method significantly improves voltage profiles and reduces power losses. Comparative findings indicate that CSGA yields superior solution quality compared to other techniques.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
