abstract: |
  The aim of this research is to define the placement of distributed generations (DGs) in radial distribution networks (RDNs) using a meta-heuristic method called the Enhanced Search Group Algorithm (ESGA). This algorithm is an upgraded version of the conventional SGA that incorporates the Chaotic Local Search (CLS) approach to improve global exploration ability. The objectives of the optimal DG placement (ODGP) problem are to decrease active power losses, increase voltage stability, and boost the voltage profile of RDNs. The study applied the ESGA to optimize the placement and size of DGs, considering two cases of power factors (unity and optimal) in 33, 69, and 118-bus RDNs. The results indicate that the ESGA method outperforms other approaches regarding solution quality, particularly for large-scale and complex networks.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study presents an Enhanced Search Group Algorithm (ESGA) for optimizing the placement and sizing of distributed generations in radial distribution networks, demonstrating superior performance in reducing power loss and enhancing voltage stability.
