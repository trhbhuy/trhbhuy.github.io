abstract: |
  This study proposes a new multi-objective version of the Search Group Algorithm (SGA) called the Multi-Objective Search Group Algorithm (MOSGA). The MOSGA integrates the conventional SGA with an elitist non-dominated sorting technique, enabling the definition of Pareto optimal solutions via mutation, offspring generation, and selection. The method is validated on twenty-five case studies, including nineteen unconstrained multi-objective benchmark problems, six constrained multi-objective benchmark problems, and five multi-objective engineering design problems. The results indicate that MOSGA is robust and superior in handling a wide variety of multi-objective problems.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces a Multi-Objective Search Group Algorithm (MOSGA) for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems, demonstrating its effectiveness on various benchmark and engineering design problems.
