abstract: |
  Producing energy from a variety of sources in a power system requires an optimal schedule to operate the power grids economically and efficiently. Nowadays, power grids might include thermal generators and renewable energy sources (RES). The integration of RES adds complexity to the optimal power flow problem due to intermittence and uncertainty. This study suggests a Multi-Objective Search Group Algorithm (MOSGA) to deal with multi-objective optimal power flow integrated with stochastic wind and solar power (MOOPF-WS) problem. The effectiveness of MOSGA was validated on the IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems considering various combinations of objective functions as well as different loading scenarios. Its performance was comprehensively compared with other multi-objective optimization algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of MOSGA in obtaining well-distributed Pareto fronts and producing better quality solutions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study proposes a Multi-Objective Search Group Algorithm (MOSGA) for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow problem with renewable energy sources, validating its effectiveness on IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems.
