abstract: |
  As the demand for hydrogen fuel increases with the rise of fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), the energy management of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) is crucial for operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel energy management model for optimal real-time energy scheduling of on-grid HRSs using generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). The proposed algorithm mimics expert demonstrations to enhance decision-making and is evaluated across a wide range of scenarios, showing that GAIL significantly improves system profitability by up to 29% compared to traditional methods.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) approach for optimizing real-time energy management of hydrogen refueling stations, demonstrating significant profit improvements.
