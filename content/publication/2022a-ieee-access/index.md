abstract: |
  This paper proposes a new multi-objective method that efficiently solves the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem in power systems. The objective of solving the MOOPF problem is to concurrently optimize the fuel cost, emissions, and active power loss. The proposed multi-objective search group algorithm (MOSGA) is an effective method that combines the merits of the original search group algorithm with fast nondominated sorting, crowding distance, and archive selection strategies to acquire a nondominated set in a single run. The MOSGA is employed on IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems to validate its robustness and efficiency. The results show that the MOSGA significantly enhances the performance of power systems in terms of economic, environmental, and technical benefits.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces a Multi-Objective Search Group Algorithm (MOSGA) for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem in power systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing fuel cost, emissions, and active power loss.
