abstract: |
  Sustainable energy is a key component of sustainable development. The current grid can be supplied by fossil fuel generators and renewable energy sources (RESs)-based generators, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power generators. This study proposes an adaptive geometry estimation-based multi-objective differential evolution (AGE-MODE) method for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow problem in hybrid thermal-wind-solar power systems. The proposed approach is validated on modified IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems, showing superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces an adaptive geometry estimation-based multi-objective differential evolution (AGE-MODE) for optimizing power flow in hybrid thermal-wind-solar systems, demonstrating superior results on IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus systems.
