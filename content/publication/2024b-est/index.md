abstract: |
  The decarbonization of electric power systems plays a critical role in global endeavors to mitigate climate change and facilitate the transition towards a sustainable energy future. This paper proposes an integrated energy hub (IEH) operational model to produce green hydrogen from biomass. The model includes renewable photovoltaic and wind sources, biomass electrolyzers, batteries, and hydrogen storage systems. To manage uncertainties from renewable sources, electricity and hydrogen demand, and energy prices, an Information Gap Decision Theory-based normalized weighted-sum (IGDT-NWS) approach is proposed. This study emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating hydrogen storage systems into the battery energy storage system, showing significant reductions in operation cost and environmental impact.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents an IGDT-based approach for optimizing the operation of an integrated energy hub with renewable energy, hybrid storage systems, and biomass-to-hydrogen technology.
